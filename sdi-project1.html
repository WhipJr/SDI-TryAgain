<p>My theme for this assignment is going to start out as a simple app that determines if a number has 5 as a factor. My goal for this class is to overcome the challenges I have had in the past with it and I am not going to not focus on the story so much as an app because a story mixed with the charts I am required to follow does not mix in my mind and ultimately causes me to fail the class.</p>
